spark-yarn-hadoop-cluster-vagrant
============================

# 1. Introduction
#### Vagrant project to spin up a cluster of 4 nodes with 64-bit CentOS6.5 Linux virtual machines with Hadoop v2.6.5, Spark v2.2.0. (and Hive v1.2.1)

This is suitable as a quick hands-on and development cluster for playing on the hadoop stack.
Memory Requirement: 16GB RAM.
Tested on MacBook Pro with 16GB of RAM.

Cluster Configuration:

1. node1 : HDFS NameNode + Spark Master
2. node2 : YARN ResourceManager + JobHistoryServer + ProxyServer
3. node3 : HDFS DataNode + YARN NodeManager + Spark Slave
4. node4 : HDFS DataNode + YARN NodeManager + Spark Slave


Hive is installed on all nodes

# 2. Prerequisites
1. At least 2GB memory for each VM node. Default script is for 4 nodes, so you need 8GB for the nodes, in addition to the memory for your host machine.
2. Vagrant 1.7 or higher, Virtualbox 4.3.2 or higher
3. Preserve the Unix/OSX end-of-line (EOL) characters while cloning this project; scripts will fail with Windows EOL characters.
4. Project is tested on Mac OSX 10.9 host OS on Macbook Pro with 16GB RAM
5. The Vagrant box is downloaded to the ~/.vagrant.d/boxes directory.


# 3. Downlooads
1. [Download and install VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
2. [Download and install Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html).
3. Create the vagrant box

```
vagrant box add centos65 https://github.com/2creatives/vagrant-centos/releases/download/v6.5.1/centos65-x86_64-20131205.box
```

4. Git clone this project, and change directory (cd) into this project (directory).
5. [Download Hadoop 2.6.5 into the /resources directory ]
6. [Download Spark 2.2.0 into the /resources directory]
7. [Download Java 1.8 into the /resources directory]
7. [Download Hive 1.2.1 into the /resources directory] - currently not installed.


# 4. Modifying scripts for adapting to your environment
You need to modify the scripts to adapt the VM setup to your environment and the version of the downloads  

1. `./Vagrantfile`  

 - To add/remove slaves, change the number of nodes:  

 ```
 numNodes = 4
 ```  

 - To modify the IP addresses of the vm's edit Vagrantfile. Currently IP's addresses
  are 10.10.55.101 - 10.10.55.104
  \\ ALso usefule to add this to your `/etc/hosts` file on your host machine:
  ```
   # hosts for hadoop/yarn/spark cluster
   # node1 hadoop nameserver and spark master
   10.10.55.101   node1
   # node2 yarn resourceManager + job History + proxyServer
  v10.10.55.102   node2
   # node3 and node4 HDFS DataNode + Yarn NodeManager + Spark Slave
   10.10.55.103   node3
   10.10.55.104   node4
  ```

1. To modify VM memory change the following line:  

```
v.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--memory", "1024"]
```

2. `/scripts/common.sh`  
  Java :Based on the version you have to change this as follows

```
JAVA_ARCHIVE=jdk-8u91-linux-x64.tar.gz
```

  Hadoop: To use a different version of Hadoop you've already downloaded to /resources directory, change the following line:  

```
HADOOP_VERSION=hadoop-2.6.0
```  

To use a different version of Hadoop to be downloaded, change the remote URL in the following line:  

```
HADOOP_MIRROR_DOWNLOAD=http://apache.crihan.fr/dist/hadoop/common/stable/hadoop-2.6.0.tar.gz
```  

Spark: To use a different version of Spark, change the following lines:  

```
SPARK_VERSION=spark-1.6.1
SPARK_ARCHIVE=$SPARK_VERSION-bin-hadoop2.6.tgz  
SPARK_ARCHIVE_DIR=$SPARK_VERSION-bin-hadoop2.6
SPARK_MIRROR_DOWNLOAD=../resources/spark-1.6.1-bin-hadoop2.6.tgz

```  

Hive: To use a different version of Hive, change the following lines

```
HIVE_VERSION=hive-1.2.1
HIVE_ARCHIVE=apache-hive-1.2.1-bin.tar.gz
HIVE_ARCHIVE_DIR=apache-hive-1.2.1-bin
HIVE_MIRROR_DOWNLOAD=../resources/apache-hive-1.2.1-bin.tar.gz
```


3. `/scripts/setup-java.sh`  
To install from Java downloaded locally in /resources directory, if different from default version (jdk1.8.0_91), change the version in the following line:  

```
ln -s /usr/local/jdk1.8.0_91 /usr/local/java
yum install -y jdk-8u25-linux-i586
```


4. `/scripts/setup-centos-ssh.sh`  
To modify the version of sshpass to use, change the following lines within the function installSSHPass():  

```
wget http://pkgs.repoforge.org/sshpass/sshpass-1.05-1.el6.rf.i686.rpm
rpm -ivh sshpass-1.05-1.el6.rf.i686.rpm
```  

5. `/scripts/setup-spark.sh`  
To modify the version of Spark to be used, if different from default version (built for Hadoop2.6), change the version suffix in the following line:  

```
ln -s /usr/local/$SPARK_VERSION-bin-hadoop2.6 /usr/local/spark
```  

# 3. Getting Started
- Run `vagrant up` to create the VM.
- Run `vagrant ssh` to get into your VM.
- Run `vagrant halt` to gracefully shutdown the VM's. You can later startup the cluster with `vagrant up` but have to repeat the #5 Post Provisioning again.
- Run `vagrant destroy` when you want to destroy and get rid of the VM to free up your disk space.

# 5. Post Provisioning
After you have provisioned the cluster, you need to run some commands to initialize your Hadoop cluster.

- SSH into node1 using  `vagrant ssh node-1`

Commands below require root permissions.

- Change to root access using `sudo su` (or create a new user and grant permissions if you want to use a non-root access. In such a case, you'll need to do this on VMs)

##### 5.1 Issue the following command at node1.

```
$HADOOP_PREFIX/bin/hdfs namenode -format myhadoop

## Start Hadoop Daemons (HDFS + YARN)

1. $HADOOP_PREFIX/sbin/hadoop-daemon.sh --config $HADOOP_CONF_DIR --script hdfs start namenode
2. $HADOOP_PREFIX/sbin/hadoop-daemons.sh --config $HADOOP_CONF_DIR --script hdfs start datanode

```

##### 5.2 SSH into node2 and issue the following commands to start YARN.

```
1. $HADOOP_YARN_HOME/sbin/yarn-daemon.sh --config $HADOOP_CONF_DIR start resourcemanager
2. $HADOOP_YARN_HOME/sbin/yarn-daemons.sh --config $HADOOP_CONF_DIR start nodemanager
3. $HADOOP_YARN_HOME/sbin/yarn-daemon.sh start proxyserver --config $HADOOP_CONF_DIR
4. $HADOOP_PREFIX/sbin/mr-jobhistory-daemon.sh start historyserver --config $HADOOP_CONF_DIR
```

### Test YARN
Run the following command to make sure you can run a MapReduce job.

```
yarn jar /usr/local/hadoop/share/hadoop/mapreduce/hadoop-mapreduce-examples-2.6.0.jar pi 2 100
```

## Start Spark in Standalone Mode
SSH into node1 (spark master) and issue the following command

```
$SPARK_HOME/sbin/start-all.sh
```

### Test Spark on YARN
You can test if Spark can run on YARN by issuing the following command from the spark master node (node-1)

```
$SPARK_HOME/bin/spark-submit --class org.apache.spark.examples.SparkPi \
    --master yarn-cluster \
    --num-executors 10 \
    --executor-cores 2 \
    $SPARK_HOME/examples/jars/spark-examples*.jar \
    100
```

### Test Spark using Shell
Start the Spark shell using the following command. Try NOT to run this command on the slave nodes.

```
$SPARK_HOME/bin/spark-shell --master spark://node1:7077
```

Then go here https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/quick-start.html to start the tutorial. You will have to load data into HDFS to make the tutorial work.

# 6. Web UI
You can check the following URLs to monitor the Hadoop daemons.

1. [NameNode] (http://10.10.55.101:50070/dfshealth.html)
2. [ResourceManager] (http://10.10.55.102:8088/cluster)
3. [JobHistory] (http://10.10.55.102:19888/jobhistory)
